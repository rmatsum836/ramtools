# ramtools
A collection of functions to aid in the study of molecular simulation.  Analyses include:
- Nernst-Einstein conductivity
- Einstein-Helfand conductivity
- Number density functions
- high frequency shear modulus

## Dependencies
As this package is slowly getting cleaned up, a `requirements.txt` file will be added so users can easily
pip install the dependencies.  Most functions depend on the `MDTraj.trajectory` object or
`MDAnalysis.Universe` object.

## Coming Soon
- Angle distribution analysis of water
- CI integration
